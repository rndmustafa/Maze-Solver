# Maze Solver

Create a maze, set your start and end points, and specify a search strategy to find a path to the end node.

Left click and hold to create rectangle.
Right click to delete rectangle. 
Green node is starting node, red node is ending.

## TODO List:
* Improve node generation
* Use async/await instead of timeouts
* Add more search algorithms
* Better painting tools
* Preset mazes
* Better color scheme and style. Add Animations.
* Prevent spamming of start search
